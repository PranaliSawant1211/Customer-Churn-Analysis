# CHURN SHIELD: Customer Churn Analysis

**CHURN SHIELD** is a data-driven solution designed to proactively identify at-risk customers and mitigate revenue loss in competitive markets. By leveraging machine learning techniques, AI-powered insights, and interactive visualizations, this project enables businesses to analyze customer churn patterns, predict churn probability, and implement effective retention strategies.

## üöÄ Overview

This project focuses on addressing customer churn by combining AI, machine learning, and business intelligence tools to generate actionable insights. The solution empowers organizations to retain customers effectively and reduce churn-related losses.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SMOTEENN
- **Power BI**: Interactive Dashboards, KPI Metrics Visualization
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**:
  - XGBoost: For predictive modeling
  - SMOTEENN: For handling class imbalances in datasets

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **AI-Driven Predictions**
- **XGBoost Model**: Selected for its superior performance, particularly on imbalanced datasets.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuned model parameters for optimal accuracy and reliability in churn predictions.

### 2. **Power BI Dashboard**
Designed an interactive dashboard to provide actionable insights and key performance indicators (KPIs), including:
- **Retention Rate**: Visualized the percentage of customers retained over a given period.
- **Churn Rate**: Highlighted the proportion of customers likely to churn.
- **Revenue Lost to Churn**: Estimated the financial impact of customer attrition.

### 3. **Automated Insights**
- Automated data cleaning and feature engineering workflows to streamline analysis.
- AI-driven churn probability predictions to assist in proactive decision-making.
- Insights aligned with industry benchmarks for competitive advantage.

## üí° Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the Telco Customer Churn dataset using Python.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed statistical analysis to uncover patterns and trends.
3. **Modeling and Predictions**:
   - Implemented XGBoost for churn prediction.
   - Addressed class imbalance with SMOTEENN.
4. **Dashboard Creation**: Built a Power BI dashboard to visualize churn-related KPIs and business insights.
